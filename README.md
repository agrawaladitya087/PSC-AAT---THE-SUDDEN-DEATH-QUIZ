1.	Introduction 
•	The ‘The Sudden Death Quiz’ is an interactive console-based computer program that uses C as its programming language. It has been created with an intention to check out a user’s overall knowledge on a number of subjects like Computer Science, Mythology, Sports, and History. The main idea here is to apply basic concepts pertaining to programming, such as functions, conditional statements, and control structures, into practice.

2. Project Overview The project consists of two different levels of difficulty.
•	Level 1 (Qualifying Round): The user picks a particular subject area they want. They get 5 questions and have to get at least 3 points to proceed. It emphasizes user input and knowledge pertaining to the subject area.
•	Level 2 - Sudden Death: It is a very competitive “Master Level” with a combination of general knowledge questions. It uses a concept of “Sudden Death” wherein an incorrectly answered question will end the game.

3. Technical Scope The project illustrates the efficiency of C language programming for logical operations. Technical specifications include:
•	Modular Programming: Employing a user-defined function (ask a question) to eliminate repeated coding.
•	Control Structures: Implementation of switch-case for controlling menu operations and if-else statements for making decisions.
•	Jump Statements: Effective utilisation of “goto” statements to deal with the ‘Game Over’ situation efficiently at Level 2.
